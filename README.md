# 1. Introduction to HTTP

## 1.1. What is HTTP

As soon as a user opens a web browser and enters a URL, they are indirectly making use of HTTP. 

HTTP sends a **request** to the web server and fetches the **response** or data from the web server.

 </figure>
</p>

- HTTP stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol**.
- It is a **set of rules and regulations** for data transfer and communication on the web (between servers and clients).
- HTTP is a **stateless protocol**, meaning each request is independent of the others.
- HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

---

## 1.2. Protocol

A **protocol** is a set of rules or standards that two sides (client and server) agree on to communicate. Here are some common protocols:

| Protocol | Description                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `IP`     | **Internet Protocol**                            |
| `TCP`    | **Transmission Control Protocol**                |
| `HTTP`   | **HyperText Transfer Protocol**                  |
| `FTP`    | **File Transfer Protocol**                       |
| `SMTP`   | **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol** (for emails)   |

---

## 1.3. HTTP Communication

### Client

Clients, often web browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Safari, perform the following tasks:

- Send a **request** to the server.
- Wait for a **response**.
- Display the results received from the server.

### Web Server

Web servers are often located in the cloud and continuously listen for requests. They:

- Accept the **request** sent by the client.
- Process the request by sending it to a specific website or web application.
- Forward the website's **response** back to the client.

## 1.4. HTTP Communication - Request

An HTTP request message consists of the following:

- **URL**: The domain/path of the requested page.
- **Request Headers**: Browser, OS, date & time, cookies, authentication info.
- **HTTP Request Method**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **Content/Data**: Sent during POST/PUT requests.

---

## 1.5. HTTP Communication - Response

An HTTP response message consists of:

- **Response Headers**: Status code (200, 400, etc.), cookies, content type.
- **Content/Data**: The requested data from the server, such as HTML.

You can inspect HTTP requests and responses using the browser‚Äôs developer tools (Network tab).

---

## 1.6. HTTP Methods

Commonly used HTTP methods include:

- **GET**: Retrieve data from the server.
- **POST**: Submit data to the server.
- **PUT**: Update data on the server.
- **DELETE**: Remove data from the server.

---

## 1.7. HTTP vs HTTPS

**HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)** encrypts data and is used to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. It uses SSL/TLS for secure communication.

---

## 1.8. HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes indicate the result of an HTTP request. Common status codes include:

| Status Code | Description                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| `200`       | OK                           |
| `301`       | Moved Permanently            |
| `400`       | Bad Request                  |
| `401`       | Unauthorized                 |
| `403`       | Forbidden                    |
| `404`       | Not Found                    |
| `500`       | Internal Server Error        |

## 1.9. HTTP/2

HTTP/2 is a major revision of HTTP, offering improvements such as faster response times, multiplexing, and enhanced security.
